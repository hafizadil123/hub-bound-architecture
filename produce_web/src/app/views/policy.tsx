</p>
<h6 className="mt-4">External Links
</h6>
<p className="mt-4">The Platform may contain links to third-party websites.  If you use these links, you will leave the Platform.  We have not reviewed these third-party sites and do not control and are not responsible for any of these sites, their content, or their privacy policy.  Thus, we do not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software, or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them.  If you decide to access any of the third-party sites listed on our Platform, you do so at your own risk.
</p>
<h6 className="mt-4">Data Security
</h6>
<p className="mt-4">We employ physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the personal information we collect online.  However, no website, App or platform is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Platform or to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
</p>
<h6 className="mt-4">Data Retention
</h6>
<p className="mt-4">We retain personal information about you necessary to fulfill the purpose for which that information was collected or as required or permitted by law.  We do not retain personal information longer than is necessary for us to achieve the purposes for which we collected it.  When we destroy your personal information, we do so in a way that prevents that information from being restored or reconstructed.
</p>
<p className="mt-4">your IP address and domain name, the pages you visit on the Site, the date and time of your visit, the files that you download, the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Site, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and certain cookie information (see below).  To obtain such information, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.   </p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Cookies.</b>  We also use cookies on the Site.  Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your web browser.  A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information.  For example, cookies can be used to collect or store information about your use of the Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your computer’s operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before the Site, and the link you used to leave the Site.  If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it.  You can also delete cookies from your computer.  However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Site may not operate correctly. 
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Web beacons.</b>  The Site or the emails that you receive from PL may use an application known as a “web beacon” (also known as a “clear gif” or “web bug”).  A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image.  It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information.  For example, it can allow an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>SDKs and mobile advertising IDs. </b>  Our Services may include third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Third-party plugins. </b>   Our Services may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies (e.g., Facebook and Google login and registration).  These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin.  These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Third-party online tracking.</b>  We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal and other information described in this section.  For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Site or in email communications from us.  This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including online website analytics. 
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Aggregated and deidentified information</b>    From time to time, we may also collect and share 
</p>
<h6 className="mt-4">With Whom and Why We Share Your Information

</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>To provide our Services.</b>    We partner with Delivery Partners, Point of Sale companies, Website Builders, In-Store Shopper services, Marketplaces, and Geographic Information Systems to provide you our Services, including to allow you to deliver goods, have goods packaged, advertise your goods, consolidate orders of goods to one feed, view aggregated data of Merchant performance, and sync Merchant business information across all partners.  We may share your information with those partners when you use our Services. 
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Analytics.</b>    We partner with certain third parties to obtain the automatically collected information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.  These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. 
</p>
<p className="mt-4"><b>Interest-based Advertising..</b>    The Platform also enables third-party tracking mechanisms to collect information about you and your computing devices for use in online interest-based advertising by our Advertisers. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited our Platform to target online ads to you.  In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of our Platform to help target advertisements based on your online activity in general.  For information about interest-based advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the<a href="">Network Advertising Initiative</a>website or the<a href="">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>website.
</p>
<p className="mt-4">The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy.  If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer or other device, you may set your browser to block cookies.  Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out here, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by opting out here.  Although our website currently does not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.

<p className="mt-4"><b>Third-party service providers.</b>    PL uses third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, including but not limited to web-hosting companies, payment processors, mailing vendors, and analytics providers.
